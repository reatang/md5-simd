## Ownership and finalization

`Raw` owns the four chaining words, a partial 64-byte block, its length, and a
wrapping `u64` byte count. `Md5` and `Md5State` use the same state machine.
Snapshot finalization copies only chaining state into the framing operation;
it leaves the stream available for further writes.

Digest 0.11 supplies its own partial-block buffer. `Md5Core` uses the chaining
state and complete-block count from `Raw`; its internal partial buffer stays
empty. Finalization passes the outer tail directly to shared framing. It does
not mutate the core to absorb the tail. This removes a second buffer transition
and the previously unreachable partial-buffer update fallback.

`frame::build_final_blocks` alone appends `0x80`, zeros, and the little-endian
bit length modulo 2^64. A tail of 0–55 bytes uses one final block; 56–63 uses two.
All one-shot, streaming, pair, and SIMD finalization paths use this builder.
`Md5::from_parts` requires a caller-supplied block-aligned state and byte count;
it is not a serialized state or an authentication primitive.

## Compression and dispatch

`consts.rs` owns IV, K, S, message-word order, and the destination cycle. Scalar
and SIMD Rust kernels use these tables. The vendored assembly retains its fixed
instruction schedule but imports K from the same table. Its immediate rotate
amounts and memory operands are part of that audited assembly program.

The textbook compressor keeps independent Boolean expressions for differential
checking; it intentionally shares RFC constants. RustCrypto `md-5` is the
independent test oracle. An internal oracle alone would not detect a corrupted
shared constant.

`backend::compress_block` is the only production single-stream selector:
`force-portable` wins, followed by x86_64 `opt` assembly, then little-endian
aarch64 `opt` (`single_aarch`, adapted from fast-md5), then portable Rust.
The batch scheduler calls that backend for fallback messages. Feature `simd`
does not enter this single-stream decision.

`update_many_dispatch` is the incremental scheduler. It works on windows of
`lanes × MAX_GROUPS` streams on aarch64 and `lanes` streams on x86_64 (where
groups are compressed sequentially and a wider window only hurts locality),
without allocating. Within a window it first
completes every partial block on the single-stream backend, then repeatedly
selects the streams that still hold a complete block and advances them over the
block count they have in common through `platform::update_equal_n`, until fewer
than four such streams remain; tails return to the single-stream backend.
`wide::update_equal_wide` loads caller chaining values into vector lanes
(`Wide::from_lanes`), runs `wide::compress_full_blocks` — the same full-block
loop `hash_equal_wide` enters from the IV — and stores them back. It applies no
padding and reads exactly `nblocks × 64` bytes per stream.

`hash_many_dispatch` validates output capacity and groups adjacent equal-length
inputs without allocation or reordering. Messages that `pick_batch` would send
to the single-stream backend go to the lane-refill scheduler (`Refill`)
instead. It keeps one window of lanes (`lanes × groups per window`, ~11 KiB on
the stack, built only when a message needs it); each lane holds one message's
chaining value and position, or its one or two padding blocks. `push` takes a
free lane, running rounds until one frees; a round finds the block count all
occupied lanes have in common and advances them through
`platform::update_equal_n`, then a lane whose message ended builds its padding
with `build_final_blocks` and, once that is compressed, writes the digest at the
message's own index and frees. `drain` at the end finishes the lanes that are
left below the SIMD threshold on the single-stream backend. Outputs are written
by index, so order is preserved without a scatter pass. The `std`-only `Md5Engine::hash_many_grouped`
entry point is an explicit scheduler option: it sorts temporary indices by
length, dispatches grouped runs, and scatters results back to original order.
`platform` chooses an available ISA.
The same generic wide kernel is inlined into the x86 `target_feature` entries;
removing that inlining can change AVX code generation significantly.

A wide call handles at most four SIMD groups. Full blocks gather active groups
then compress them. On little-endian aarch64, runs with **3+ groups** advance
the 64-step chains with instruction-level step interleaving and pipeline the
next block's gather behind the current compress. x86 keeps compresses inside
`#[target_feature]` entries and uses sequential per-group compress (measured
faster than an out-of-line interleaved helper). Single- and two-group shapes
use the tight gather→compress loop on all SIMD targets.

NEON8 uses two four-lane vectors and shares its transpose and rotate operations
with NEON4. AVX-512 gather uses AVX2 transposes plus AVX-512F inserts. Unused lanes
duplicate the last valid input pointer; they never read beyond a message or
write beyond its corresponding output slot.

## Unsafe boundary

- Scalar word reads are unaligned little-endian loads confined to a 64-byte block.
- SIMD gathers read complete 64-byte blocks; final tails are copied into local
  padded blocks before vector loads. Caller input alignment is unrestricted.
- x86 dispatch checks CPU and OS support for AVX2 and for AVX-512F plus AVX2 before
  entering those kernels. Without `std`, x86 batching conservatively falls back.
- aarch64 adapters use baseline NEON on little-endian targets. Big-endian
  targets select scalar Rust because the vector word loads do not perform
  little-endian conversion. Tests exercise Apple Silicon; big-endian fallback
  selection was checked statically, not executed.
- Internal `Wide` operations are private implementation details invoked within
  the selected ISA entry. No vector kernel is publicly callable.
- Hex conversion constructs only ASCII bytes before creating a `String`.

## API limits

`hash_many` is one-shot SIMD and `update_many` is incremental SIMD; both enter the
same full-block schedule. `finalize_many` is a sequential snapshot loop over
`Md5State` and does not batch padding blocks. The experimental pair
path stays disabled by default and does not replace the SIMD kernel.

The native `zeroize` method is best-effort clearing, not a cryptographic secret
storage guarantee. `Md5State` remains `Copy`, and Digest owns an external buffer.
The `zeroize` feature affects native `Md5` drop only. Manual clearing requires
`reset()` before normal hashing resumes.

## Regression coverage

Tests check RFC vectors, million-a, random inputs and stream splits, Clone and
snapshot behavior, Digest reset/reuse, modulo length encoding, resumed block
states, SIMD lane/group limits, unaligned inputs, mixed runs, untouched output
sentinels, full hex encoding, and reader interruptions/errors. Feature matrices
must exercise accelerated and forced-portable code separately.
